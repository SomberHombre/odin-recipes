        <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, add the tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, and enough water to completely cover them. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatillos, jalapeños, and onion to a blender. Add the cilantro, garlic, lime juice, and salt and blend until smooth. Taste and add more salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Stack the corn tortillas on top of each other and cut them into eighths to create small triangle wedges. Line a large plate with paper towels and set aside.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large sauté pan or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add half of the tortillas and fry for 8 minutes, stirring every minute or so, until they are crispy. Transfer them to the lined plate to drain and repeat the frying proess with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and tortilla wedges.</li>
        <li>Add all of the fried tortillas back to the pan and pour the salsa verde on top. Gently toss together to coat.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and garnish with cotija cheese, cilantro, onions, and Mexican crema.</li>
