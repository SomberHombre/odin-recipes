    <h2>Plate of Conchas</h2>
    <p>This recipe for Mexican pan dulce requires the simplest of ingredients and only a few simple steps. Pan dulce translates to sweet bread in English, while the term concha translates to shell. If you have ever seen these beautiful pastries, the name makes total sense. These lovely loaves look just like the delicate, multi-colored shells found along the seashore. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Active Dry Yeast Be sure to choose the active or “double rise” yeast. Instant-rise yeast will not work.</li>
        <li>Milk Use whole milk for the richest, softest bread. </li>
        <li>Butter Adds a rich savoriness that harmonizes the recipe. </li>
        <li>Sugar Youll need granulated for the dough and powdered sugar for the topping.</li>
        <li>Eggs These offer moisture, richness, and fluffiness to the batter. </li>
        <li>Vanilla Enriches the sweetness and enhances the flavor of all the other ingredients</li>
        <li>Flour Regular, all-purpose flour is the perfect fit. </li>
        <li>Topping/Craquelin A mix of butter, sugar, flour, and vanilla form the scrumptious, crunchy topping.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the Dough. Use either the stovetop or microwave to heat the milk until it is just warm to the touch, about 110 degrees F. Mix in one tablespoon of sugar and the yeast, then allow 5 minutes for it to activate and get foamy. No foam means the yeast has died, and youll need a new batch. </li>
        <li>Prepare the Wet Ingredients. Mix the vanilla extract with the eggs and set aside. Melt the butter and measure out the flour and sugar. </li>
        <li>Combine Ingredients. Add the remaining sugar, salt, and 4.5 cups of flour to the bowl of a stand mixer. Blend the mixture with your fingers, then create a well in the center. Add the foamy, active yeast, melted butter, and vanilla egg mixture to the center well. </li>
        <li>Mix the Dough. Mix everything together on medium-low speed for 8 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Since the dough will be slightly tacky, it is helpful to sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of flour inside the bowl to prevent sticking. </li>
        <li>Set Aside to Rise. Lift the dough from the bowl with a rubber spatula, spray the bowl with cooking spray, and return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a light kitchen towel and set in a warm spot to rise. You want to give it about 2 hours, or enough time for it to double in size.</li>
        <li>Make the Craquelin. Mix the powdered sugar, flour, softened butter, and vanilla together in a small bowl to form a smooth paste. Divide the topping into 12 balls, cover, and set aside. </li>
        <li>Divide the Dough. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and prepare a clean floured surface. Start by dividing the dough in half, dividing those halves in half, and then dividing each quarter into 2 pieces. Roll into 12 balls and place 6 on each baking tray.</li>
        <li>Add the Topping. Use plastic wrap and gentle pressure to flatten each craquelin ball into a flat disc large enough to cover the dough balls. Carefully peel back the plastic wrap and transfer the discs to the dough balls. Press down gently to adhere, then use a sharp knife to cut seashell patterns or other fancy designs in the topping of each pastry. </li>
        <li>Set Aside to Rise. Cover the baking sheets and set aside for 30 minutes to rise. In the meantime, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Bake the Conchas. Bake until the bottoms are a light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for at least 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
