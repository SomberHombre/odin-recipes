    <h2>Bowl of Menudo</h2>
    <p>Not everyone is into menudo, but there are few things as comforting than a warm, spicy bowl of menudo on a cold morning.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds honeycomb tripe</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef scalded tripe</li>
        <li>1 large white onion sliced in half</li>
        <li>1 whole head of garlic</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 large lemon</li>
        <li>Water enough to cover tripe generously</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chile guajillos in a pot of simmering water and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, add the chiles to the blender. Also add 2 cups of cooking water, garlic and salt to taste. Cover and blend on high until smooth. Strain chile sauce through a wire mesh strainer into a bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Slice the honeycomb and scalded tripe into bite size pieces. Place in colander and rinse well with cold water. Place in a large pot. Add 1/2 the onion, 1/2 the garlic, bay leaves and juice of 1 lemon. Cover generously with water and heat to medium. When it comes to a boil, add salt to taste and reduce to a simmer. Cook partially covered, skimming off the foam on top, for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon oregano, strained chile sauce and maiz pozolero. Stir well to combine. Bring back up to a boil, reduce to a simmer. Cook partially cover for 2 hours or until tripe cuts easily when you squeeze between your fingers and reaches an internal temperature of 160Â°F. Taste for salt. Garnish with your favorites. Serve with warm corn tortillas or toasted Mexican bolillo bread.</li>
    </ol>
